			    <td>Phuket Travel is one of the leading travel agents in the world today, with numerous branches worldwide, but it was not always this way.
					In the early 50's there were no bridges connecting Phuket to mainland Thialand, so to travel between the two a ferry was taken. The Suung Han
					family operated one such ferry crossing. With increased tourism the business prospered and expanded, and even when the first bridge was built
					in 1967 they still received much business from loyal customers, purchasing several buses the Suung Han family now transported people in a 
					different way. Due to continued expansion, by the early 80's the family had several small aircraft to travel people around Thialand and 
					Phuket. Since then Phuket travel now arrange for people to fly to over 150 different countries worldwide, and stay in the best accomodation available.

				<td>ATOL (Air Traffic Organisers Licensing) Scheme. ATOL is a protection scheme for flights and air holidays, managed by the Civil Aviation Authority.  If you've 
					booked and contracted with a licensed tour operator for a complete air holiday package or just a flight, ATOL protects you from losing money or being stranded abroad
					if the tour operator goes out of business. If a licensed firm goes out of business, the CAA can give refunds to people who canâ€™t travel and arrange for people abroad to fly home.
